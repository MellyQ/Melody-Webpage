<pre><code>    &lt;p class="bodytext"&gt; Hi, My name is &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/mel.quintero.7?fref=ts"&gt;Melody Quintero.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;I'm an 18 year old and go to St. Benedict High School. &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p class="bodytext"&gt; I enjoy playing video games, basketball and the guitar with 
    my friends and family. As well as learning Computer Science. My Dream is to be an 
    mechanical engineering and successful, so I can spoil my little siblings. Especially
    my little brother by the time he's my age. Since i was an 7th grade, I always wanted a career in engineering. As soon as I got to High school, I already had my mind set in
</code></pre>

<p>engineering but I was never quick sure which field of engineering I wanted to pursue. Math has always been my best subject since I
was in Elementary school. I loved math and design, yet I want to explorer Fuhrer. What spark my interest in technology is the same
reason it would anyone else. It's all around us 24/7. Technology is growing faster and convenient everyday. I want to be part of the
reason why technology is what it is. There's not lot of female craters and computer/technology designers out there. I had a friend, who
knew how to program in freshmen year. It use to amaze me as it was a new form of art, I have yet to had soon. No Matter what I choice
to pursue with mechanic or technological engineering. Whether the public eye like it or not, Technology would always continue to
grow. By learning how to code/program, It would always put me a head of the game. Befitting my education and career in multiple
varieties. I want to prove a point to anyone who has criticize or demolish a women abilities. My Personal goals to get from Girls Who Code is to continue as well as commit my passion with math in a whole new level.  </p>

<p>On the 3rd week of Girls Who Code, I got to work with my partner name Saloni. 
  We spent the week working together as a team to crate a JavaScript code to built a City Scroller.
  We had building and mountains in the back moving the same directions. The user would be able to color
  of the build as they please. </p>
