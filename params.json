As well as learning Computer Science. My Dream is to be an \r\n        mechanical engineering and successful, so I can spoil my little siblings. Especially\r\n        my little brother by the time he's my age. Since i was an 7th grade, I always wanted a career in engineering. As soon as I got to High school, I already had my mind set in\r\nengineering but I was never quick sure which field of engineering I wanted to pursue. Math has always been my best subject since I\r\nwas in Elementary school. I loved math and design, yet I want to explorer Fuhrer. What spark my interest in technology is the same\r\nreason it would anyone else. It's all around us 24/7. Technology is growing faster and convenient everyday. I want to be part of the\r\nreason why technology is what it is. There's not lot of female craters and computer/technology designers out there. I had a friend, who\r\nknew how to program in freshmen year. It use to amaze me as it was a new form of art, I have yet to had soon. No Matter what I choice\r\nto pursue with mechanic or technological engineering. Whether the public eye like it or not, Technology would always continue to\r\ngrow. By learning how to code/program, It would always put me a head of the game. Befitting my education and career in multiple\r\nvarieties. I want to prove a point to anyone who has criticize or demolish a women abilities. My Personal goals to get from Girls Who Code is to continue as well as commit my passion with math in a whole new level.  </p><br />\r\n        <p> \r\n\t\t\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n\t<div id=\"photosection\">\r\n\t\t<div id=\"imagespace\">\r\n\t\t<!--In the a tag define the link to where the image will direct you to, inside the img src reference the folder images/image.png-->\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"images/trip.PNG\">\t\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"images/melody.JPG\"> \r\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bryan.padilla.9484?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"images/pizza.PNG\"></a>\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"images/basketball.PNG\"> \r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t<div id=\"videosection\">\r\n\t\t <h2><a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/city-scroller/4772638753947648\">City Scroller</a></h2> <script src=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/city-scroller/4772638753947648/embed.js?editor=yes&amp;buttons=yes&amp;author=yes&amp;embed=yes\"></script> <p>Made using: <a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming\">Khan Academy Computer Science</a>.</p> \r\n  <p>On the 3rd week of Girls Who Code, I got to work with my partner name Saloni. \r\n  We spent the week working together as a team to crate a JavaScript code to built a City Scroller.\r\n  We had building and mountains in the back moving the same directions. The user would be able to color\r\n  of the build as they please. </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n\t\r\n\t<div id=\"footer\">\r\n\t\t<span>Created by Melody Quintero &copy;</span>\r\n\t</div>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
